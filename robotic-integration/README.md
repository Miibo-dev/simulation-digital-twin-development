# Virtual Commissioning for Robotic Integration

Digital twin for robot-conveyor integration with PLC synchronization.

## Project Overview

This project implements a digital twin for virtual commissioning of robotic systems integrated with conveyor systems. The digital twin enables validation of control logic, robot trajectories, and PLC synchronization before physical deployment, significantly reducing commissioning time and risk.

## Key Results

- Achieved high precision in virtual-to-physical translation
- Ensured robot-conveyor synchronization with PLC
- Validated control logic before deployment
- Reduced FAT (Factory Acceptance Test) and SAT (Site Acceptance Test) timeline

## Methodology

1. **Digital twin development** - Created high-fidelity simulation of robot-conveyor system
2. **PLC integration** - Connected simulation to actual PLC control logic
3. **Virtual commissioning** - Tested and validated system behavior in simulation
4. **Control logic validation** - Verified robot programs and safety logic
5. **Physical deployment** - Transferred validated configuration to production system

## Digital Twin Capabilities

The digital twin implementation provides:
- **Bidirectional communication** with PLC systems
- **Real-time synchronization** of robot and conveyor movements
- **Virtual-to-physical translation** ensuring accurate behavior transfer
- **Safety logic validation** before physical deployment

## Technologies Used

- Digital Twin implementation
- PLC integration and communication protocols
- Robot simulation and trajectory planning
- Virtual commissioning tools
- Control logic validation

## Outcomes

Virtual commissioning delivered:
- Reduced FAT and SAT timeline through pre-validated logic
- High-precision virtual-to-physical translation
- Early detection of integration issues
- Risk mitigation through virtual validation
